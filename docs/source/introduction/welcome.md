# Welcome


Council is an open-source framework for the rapid development and robust deployment of customized generative AI applications using teams of `agents` - built in Python and (soon) Rust.

Council extends the LLM tool ecosystem by enabling advanced control and scalable oversight for AI agents. Users can create sophisticated agents with predictable behavior by leveraging Council's powerful approach to control flow using Controllers, Filters, Evaluators and Budgets for agents. This allows the automated routing between agents, comparing, evaluating and selecting the best results for a (sub-)task. 

The framework provides connectivity to a wide variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) natively and by integrating with popular libraries such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.

Council aims to facilitate packaging and seamlessly deploying Agents at scale on multiple deployment platforms while enabling enterprise-grade monitoring and advanced quality control in a future release (contributions are welcome).
