"""

A module for initializing various components of a language model-based system.

This module imports and provides the foundational building blocks for constructing and operating
language model agents, chains of agents, contexts, controllers, evaluators, and filters. Additionally, it
includes the specification for implementations of language model interfaces for Anthropic, Azure, and
OpenAI large language models (LLMs). Administrative structures like Chain Context and Skill Context are
imported for coordination of chain operations and management of skills within the agents, respectively.

Lastly, the module imports various runner objects to control the execution flow such as loops and
conditional executions that can operate either sequentially or in parallel.
