"""

A module that contains the schema for creating a reference to a response.

This module defines a class `ResponseReference`, which encapsulates the information related to
a reference for a response, including its title, URL, and optionally a snippet and a
date associated with the response.

Classes:
    ResponseReference: A data structure that holds the details of a response reference.

Attributes:
    title (str): The title of the response reference.
    url (str): The URL pointing to the sourced content of the response.
    snippet (Optional[str]): An optional text snippet summarizing the response. Defaults to None if unset.
    date (Optional[str]): An optional string representation of the date associated with the response. Defaults to None if unset.

Methods:
    __init__(self, title: str, url: str, snippet: Optional[str], date: Optional[str]):
        Initializes a new instance of ResponseReference.

    __str__(self) -> str:
        Returns a string representation of the ResponseReference instance.

    dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        Returns a dictionary representation of the ResponseReference instance, which can be useful for serialization.
