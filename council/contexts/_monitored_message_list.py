"""

A module that wraps the MessageList to additionally log messages as they are appended to the list.

This module provides a MonitoredMessageList class which inherits from the MessageCollection abstract base class, adding the capability to log each message using an ExecutionLogEntry instance before the message is added to the internal list.

Classes:
    MonitoredMessageList: A collection of chat messages that also records each message via an ExecutionLogEntry.

class MonitoredMessageList(MessageCollection):
    """
    A list-like class responsible for storing and logging chat messages within a MonitoredMessageList object.
    This class acts as a wrapper around another MessageCollection object, allowing for additional
    functionality such as the ability to log each message that is appended to the list.
    
    Attributes:
        _inner (MessageList):
             An instance of MessageList which is being monitored.
        Properties:
        messages (Iterable[ChatMessage]):
             Provides an iterable of ChatMessage objects contained in the inner MessageList.
        reversed (Iterable[ChatMessage]):
             Provides an iterable of ChatMessage objects in reverse order contained in the inner MessageList.
    
    Methods:
        __init__(self, message_list:
             MessageList): Initializes a new instance of MonitoredMessageList.
        append(self, message:
             ChatMessage, log_entry: ExecutionLogEntry): Appends a ChatMessage to the monitored MessageList and logs the operation.

        Initializes an instance of the enclosing class with a given MessageList object.
        
        Args:
            message_list (MessageList):
                 An instance of MessageList to be encapsulated by the enclosing object.
            Description:
                This constructor method is called when a new instance of the containing class is created. It initializes the objectâ€™s internal state by setting an `_inner` attribute to the value of the `message_list` passed to it. This allows the object to maintain a reference to the given MessageList object, presuming that MessageList is a defined class or type in the context which supports certain operations expected by the containing class.

            The property provides an iterable over the internal `_inner` collection's `.reversed` attribute, allowing the consumer to iterate through chat messages starting from the most recent one to the oldest.
        
        Returns:
            (Iterable[ChatMessage]):
                 An iterable object that allows iterating through chat messages in reverse chronological order.
