"""

A module that defines a custom exception class, ScorerException, which is intended to used for exceptions specifically related to the scoring process in an application. This custom exception class extends the base Exception class provided by Python and does not add any additional functionality or attributes. It serves as a distinctive exception type that can be raised and caught to handle errors that are unique to the scoring context, allowing for more granular exception handling and clearer error messaging.


"""
class ScorerException(Exception):
    """
    Custom exception for handling errors within a scoring system.
    This exception is raised when an error occurs specifically within the context of a scoring operation. It inherits from Python's built-in Exception class, thereby gaining all its functionalities. Instances of this class can be initialized with a custom message that can be displayed when the exception is caught and handled. The ScorerException should be used whenever there is a scoring-related error that doesn't fit within the other more specific exceptions available.
